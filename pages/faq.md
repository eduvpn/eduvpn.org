### Client

#### I found a bug in the eduVPN client, how can I report it?

All known issues in the eduVPN clients are published on GitHub. Please report 
issues with detailed information including OS version, client version and 
log-files directly in GitHub. Please make sure there is no personal data 
included, because this bug information will be public.

* [Windows](https://github.com/Amebis/eduVPN/issues)
* [macOS & iOS](https://github.com/eduvpn/apple/issues)
* [Android](https://github.com/eduvpn/android/issues)
* [Linux](https://github.com/eduvpn/python-eduvpn-client/issues)

#### After install, client asks "repair" or "uninstall" (Windows)

After installing the eduVPN Windows client, some users experience a "repair or 
uninstall" notification in the client.

The notification indicates that an eduVPN component didn't install correctly. 
Sometimes a Windows reboot solves the issue. In other cases, we noticed Windows 
update was not working, so the computer wasn't up to date. Trying to fix the 
Windows update functionality might solve the issue.

#### Virus scanner reports suspicious software when installing the client (Windows)

Make sure you've downloaded the eduVPN client via 
[https://app.eduvpn.org/](https://app.eduvpn.org/) If this is the case, it is 
probably a false positive notification. Nowadays some virus scanners accept 
only applications they know about, which means that if we release a new version, 
they might alert you because they didn't see the binary anywhere before. In order 
to avoid false positives, we will always upload our new eduVPN clients to 
[Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) Via this platform, all virus scanners 
will become aware of our new software releases. You can always check our 
binaries yourselves via VirusTotal, just upload the binary and view the report.

#### eduVPN client is only available in the App Store for macOS 10.14 and higher (macOS)

In order to 'be' in the App Store with the eduVPN client, we had to implement a 
specific functionality (`NetworkExtensions`). This is only available for macOS 
10.14 and later. For users with older macOS versions, we advice to use 
[Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/). How to use it? Install the Tunnelblick 
client, login to your eduVPN server, go to "configurations" and create a 
configuration. You can download the configuration file as .ovpn and import it 
in Tunnelblick. You can now start/stop the VPN in Tunnelblick. **Be aware** the 
configuration file has an expiry time (by default 90 days). When the 
configuration expires, you can't use it anymore in Tunnelblick and need to 
create and download a new one. Unfortunately you won't get any descent 
notification about the expiry, it just won't connect. However in the log-file 
of Tunnelblick you can see the certificate expired.

### Server

#### Can we have an IPv4 only VPN?

eduVPN is a full dual-stack IPv6 solution. It was built from the start with 
support for IPv4 and IPv6. Even if IPv6 is not used "upstream", the client will
still get assigned an IPv6 address as well as an IPv4 address. IPv6 support was
a hard requirement for some organizations that were involved in the initial 
development of eduVPN, and thus we never even made this "optional". 

We believe that supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 equally is something every (VPN) 
service should have done already for a very long time and avoids having to 
deal with "leaking" IPv6 traffic outside of the VPN tunnel in some scenarios.

That being said, if you deploy eduVPN at your organization, and IPv6 is not 
available there, you can always assign 
[ULA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address) addresses to the 
clients and simply drop all IPv6 traffic on your VPN server using its built-in
firewall.
