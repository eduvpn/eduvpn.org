eduVPN is a VPN service provided for the international research and education 
community. It aims to offer both secure access to campus networks as well as 
the ability to be safer when using the Internet when 
[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/) is not available and you are relying on 
insecure WiFi networks to connect. The essential eduVPN user experience should 
be: "open your laptop and be securely online".

eduVPN service instances offered by NRENs or universities, research labs, etc., 
allow students, researchers and staff from participating institutions to obtain 
a VPN connection on their devices to known end-points.

### Secure Internet

_Secure Internet_ provides secure and privacy preserving access from public 
networks: by providing secure gateways to trusted networks that end-users can 
tunnel to when using insecure networks, in particular public WiFi hot spots.

### Institute Access

_Institute Access_ provides access to private networks: a "corporate" VPN 
solution as it were, where end-users can access internal resources within the 
internal network of their university. In this case, eduVPN has similar 
functionalities as a typical VPN concentrator box. The service can also be used 
to connect different campuses or networks (VLANs) within a single institution.
